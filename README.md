In this project, I had my Geometry students run a simplified version of the Buffon's Needle experiment.

"Buffon's Needle is one of the oldest problems in the field of geometrical probability. It was first stated in 1777. It involves dropping a needle on a lined sheet of paper and determining the probability of the needle crossing one of the lines on the page. The remarkable result is that the probability is directly related to the value of pi." - Office of Mathematics, Science, and Technology from the University of Illinios

If you conducted this experiment an insane amount of iterations, the propability will result an aproximation of pi.

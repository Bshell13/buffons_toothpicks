    "# Buffon's Toothpick Classroom Experiment\n",
    "### Brandon Shellenberger\n",
    "In this experiment, Buffon wanted to know the probability a needle intersecting atleast one line of a set of parallel lines when dropped from a random hieght. These lines are spaced evenly at a distance equal to the length of the needle being used. Buffon used different variables like the angle at which the needle dropped relative to the parallel lines, distance from the center of the needle to the closest line, the length of the needle, and the distance between parallel lines.\n",

    "These will be the questions answered throughout the project:\n",
    "1. What is the average number of toothpicks that are intersecting a line?\n",
    "2. Which student has the best average of a toothpick intersecting a line?\n",
    "3. Which class had the beset average of a toothpick intersecting a line?\n",
    "4. What is the propability of a single toothpick intersecting a line?"
